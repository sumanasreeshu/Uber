# Uber Rides Data Analysis

*Project Overview*

This project analyzes Uber ride data from April to September. The goal is to identify patterns and insights within the data, including trends related to time of day, day of the week, and monthly variations. Additionally, the project examines Uber base performance across various times and days, aiming to uncover actionable insights for improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

*Techniques Used*

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Converted date formats, extracted day, month, and time components, and created new time-based fields to streamline the analysis.
Data Manipulation: Aggregated data by hour, day, and Uber base for comprehensive time-based insights.
Visualization: Generated various graphs, including bar plots, heat maps, and tables, to display ride distribution across times, days, and months.

*Impactful Outcomes*

Peak Booking Times: Most Uber rides occur between 3 PM and 9 PM, with notable peaks around 5 PM, indicating high demand during commuting hours.
Monthly Trends: Ride numbers nearly doubled from April to September, with September having the highest volume.
Base Analysis: Bases B02598, B02617, and B02682 showed high trip volumes, while B02512 and B02764 had lower numbers, suggesting areas for potential operational improvement.
Day of the Week Patterns: Thursdays and Fridays saw the highest ride numbers, while Sundays were significantly lower, indicating weekend demand drop-offs.

*Conclusions*

The analysis revealed that Uber ride demand is strongly influenced by commuting hours, specific days, and months. The identified peak times, high-performing bases, and weekly patterns provide valuable insights into optimizing service availability and enhancing user experience. Adjustments targeting these peak demand periods could improve service efficiency and potentially increase revenue.
